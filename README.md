# GTP Interview - Tech Test

A tech-test that was completed as part of the interview with the Government Technlogy Platforms (GTP) team. Built using React Typescript. The basic code and styling was provided by the interviewer.

## MVP

The final app should do the following:

- [x] Show Good morning message only on button click.
- [x] Change the button label to Hide greeting
- [x] When Hide greeting button is clicked, hide Good morning message
- [x] Welcome alert should be not be shown when the button is clicked.
- [x] User should be able to enter the name in the input box
- [x] Once the name is entered and clicked on submit, show good morning message with name.
- [x] Show the number of times greeting button was clicked in the counter input box

## Challenges

- As I am new to typescript, I was initially a bit unsure about how to type the function callbacks, but once I got past this initial challenge, the remaining were relatively easier to solve.

## Reflection/Learning

- I need to spend more time to learn typescript, but I am getting the hang of it.
- Disregarding the typescript aspect of the challenge, I feel more confident in my abilities with React, as I was able to get through the rest of the challenge relatively quickly.

## Compiling and running the app

Start by cloning the repo to your local device

Once your have changed directories into the "gtp-tech-test" folder in your Terminal, make sure to install the dependencies before running the app.

```
cd gtp-tech-test
npm install
npm run dev
```
